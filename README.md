# ðŸ”º Pascal's Triangle â€“ C++ Implementation

This C++ program prints **Pascal's Triangle** in three flexible ways:

1. âœ… A **specific element** from any row & column  
2. âœ… A **full row** of Pascal's Triangle  
3. âœ… The **entire triangle** up to a given number of rows  

All this is done using an efficient method to compute combinations (`nCr`) without using factorials â€” making it optimal and interview-friendly.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- **Optimized** `nCr` calculation using iterative approach (no factorials)
- Modular, clean, and reusable functions
- User-friendly code with helpful comments
- Easy to test and extend

---

## ðŸ”§ How to Use

```bash
g++ -o Pascal Pascal.cpp
./Pascal
```

---
### âž¤ To print a specific element at (col, row):
```cpp
PrintSpecificElement(col, row);
```
### âž¤ To print an entire row:
```cpp
PrintPascalRow(row);
```
### âž¤ To print the whole Pascal Triangle:
```cpp
PrintWholeTriangle(rowLimit);
```
